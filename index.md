About Otto Österman

My name is Otto Österman and I am the creator of this website, which was done as a part of Aalto's DevOps course. I am currently studying my master's degree in Human-Technology Interaction at Tampere University and aim to graduate in 2020. I work for CGI Finland, a Canadian owned IT company based in over 40 countries. I am a programmer/UX/UI Designer, which is very nice mixed of different aspects of an IT project. I get to be invloved from the start of the project to the end of the project - from designing to implementing. Looking forward to meeting you!

Anyway, here's my cat Waldo.
