#### This course is awesome!
I decided to take the introductory course to DevOps for several reasons. First, it was offered as a fully online course, which really was the only option for me as someone who is working full-time and living in Tampere. I also like to progress at my own pace when learning new things and this course seemed to make that possible. No weekly exercises and deadlines or anything like that. Second, I was interested in the topic. I didn't know anything about it before this course. After reading a bit about the topic from the course materials, I realised we have done some DevOps activities at work already. The project I am involved in uses a CI/CD pipeline that build and deploys after each commit to our software project. At work, I have also encountered the term "DevOps" multiple times during my couple of years at the company and heard we even have our own DevOps department! I just didn't know what it was and why it existed. Curiosity got the better of me and I'm glad it did. I really did not know what to expect from the course because I did not know much about DevOps. I was happily surprised the course included some hands-on exercises.Furthermore, I believe that this course will be beneficial for me in whatever career path I decide to follow in the future, because DevOps seem to be a part of every medium to large sized IT company nowadays.

#### Learning DevOps is great!
