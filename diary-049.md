#### This course is awesome!
I decided to take the introductory course to DevOps for several reasons. First, it was offered as a fully online course, which really was the only option for me as someone who is working full-time and living in Tampere. I also like to progress at my own pace when learning new things and this course seemed to make that possible. No weekly exercises and deadlines or anything like that. Second, I was interested in the topic. I didn't know anything about it before this course. After reading a bit about the topic from the course materials, I realised we have done some DevOps activities at work already. The project I am involved in uses a CI/CD pipeline that build and deploys after each commit to our software project. At work, I have also encountered the term "DevOps" multiple times during my couple of years at the company and heard we even have our own DevOps department! I just didn't know what it was and why it existed. Curiosity got the better of me and I'm glad it did.

I really did not know what to expect from the course because I did not know much about DevOps. I was happily surprised the course included some hands-on exercises.Furthermore, I believe that this course will be beneficial for me in whatever career path I decide to follow in the future, because DevOps seem to be a part of every medium to large sized IT company nowadays.

#### Learning DevOps is great!
As I already mentioned in the previous section, we are using a CI/CD pipeline at a software project at work. I am a frontend developer in the project (although I do some backend stuff as well), but I still had to get a more experienced colleague to come and create the pipeline for the project, because I did not know how to do it or what it even was and it was a requirement to have it. After he did it, I inspected his code (the .yml file) and to be honest, I did not understand how it worked at all. Now after taking this course I think I could do it myself with a little bit of googling around and maybe just asking for advice.

I did pretty well in the questionnaires. If I remember correctly, I got 28 points. Still, I considered myself somewhat experienced in programming and decided to go with the advanced project even though I could have just gone with the starter one considering my questionnaire points. Everything went smoothly. I installed Hugo and all other things that were needed. I use git every day at work so that wasn't hard for me either. I got my Hugo site running locally and it looked pretty cool with the Solar theme. Travis on the other hand was completely new to me. When it came to writing the .yml file, I was pretty lost. The materials provided were of no help as the tutorial that was linked pretty much said "You'll figure it out with Google". After hitting page 10 of Google result on my 50th search term and going through countless of other people's .yml files, I decided it's not worth it and did this started project in two hours.

To sum up, the most challenging part was figuring out what to do in the .yml file. I am fairly sure I would get it right with more time, but because of time constraints, I could not do it now. The most useful thing I learned was basically "What is DevOps" as it was quite unknown to me. Hands-on stuff was very challenging and I learned a lot from it even though I could not finish.
